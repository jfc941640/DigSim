Thank you for your registration to the Java Cup International!  Sun
Microsystems is proud to have received your registration.

A couple of housekeeping details before you get coding:

  * Be sure to read the Official Rules carefully.

  * Once you have made your submission, you will not have access to make any
    modifications, so make sure your submission is final.

  * The Code number below for your submission is unique to your record.  To
    ensure that no one else will have access to your applet submission,
    do not share the Code with anyone.

  * DO NOT LOSE THIS E-MAIL! Make a backup copy for your eventual
    submission instruction and include with your *.tar file.

  * You will be notified by snail-mail if you are one of the first 1,000
    registrants or first 1,000 applet submission entries that you have won a
    Java T-shirt or Java mug.

Get coding, Duke is waiting!

                         SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS
============================================================================

Submissions will be accepted via anonymous ftp from 1/8/96 through 3/31/96.
It is important that you follow the directions below or your submission will 
not be accepted.

  Save a copy of this mail to a file called 'sub_form'.  You will be 
  required to include a copy in your submission archive, as noted below.

  Use 'tar' to archive your entire Java application.  Your tar file should 
  be given the eight character ID name listed above.  Any other name will not 
  get filed correctly with your registration entry and therefore will not be 
  accepted.

  The tar file will include:

    * All images, sounds, source code (*.java) and compiled classes
      (*.classes) and a local html page with the embedded applet.

    * Everything necessary to run the applet locally by the judges is
      required for entry. If the applet is not ready to run, it will not
      be considered. 

    * If the applet requires the Internet for any kind of the data feed
      and the data feed is not available to us at the time of
      judging, ensure that you can simulate that data feed locally from
      a file. That file should be included as part of the submittal.

    * A copy of this mail named 'sub_form'.

    * A 'README' file if necessary.

  Login using Anonymous FTP to javacontest.sun.com.  Use the name
  'anonymous' and enter your e-mail address for the password.  Then 
  place your tar file in the /incoming directory.

    % ftp javacontest.sun.com
    Connected to javacontest.sun.com.

    Name: anonymous
    Password: j.doe@foo.com (your e-mail address)

    ftp> cd incoming
    ftp> put QWEFAEFF.tar (your file name)
    ftp> quit

Your registration is now complete. Shortly after your have made your ftp
submission, per the instructions above, you will receive a submission
confirmation e-mail.  Judging will take place in accordance with the rules
at <http://javacontest.sun.com>.  Winners will be announced in May, 1996.
