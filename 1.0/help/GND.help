GND (ground)

A GND Pin has always level 0.
Place it anywere in your schematic, you don't have
to draw long ground wires

    0 = inactive = GND = 0V = OFF
        (Wires are green when inactive)
    1 = active = Vcc = 5V = ON
        (Wires are red when active)

You can drag this component to another position
by clicking inside the body of the port, hold
the mouse button, move to the new position,
and release the mouse button.
