JK flip flop

You can compare this flip-flop with a SR flipflop,
with 'J' = set and 'K' = reset.
The not defined SR=11 (here JK=11) is now specified
as toggle; both outputs changes when JK=11.

In boolean logic: Q(n + 1) = J.Q'(n) + K'Q(n)

You can drag this component to another position
by clicking inside the body of the port, hold
the mouse button, move to the new position,
and release the mouse button.
