8 bit parallel in shift register

To parallel load this shift register, hold the LD
input low. Clocking is accomplished on the low-
to high level edge of the clock pulse.
A direct reset input overrides all other inputs,
including the clock, and sets all flip flops to
zero.

You can drag this component to another position
by clicking inside the body of the port, hold
the mouse button, move to the new position,
and release the mouse button.
