4-bit binary counter

This counter contains four master-slave flip flops.
The input count pulses are applied to input C,
which is triggered on the low-to-high level
transition.

You can drag this component to another position
by clicking inside the body of the port, hold
the mouse button, move to the new position,
and release the mouse button.
