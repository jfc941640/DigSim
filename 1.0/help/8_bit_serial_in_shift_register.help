8-bit serial input shift register

This it a 8 bit shift register that shift the data
in the direction of 1 toward 8 when clocked.
Clocking is accomplished on the low- to high
level edge of the clock pulse.
A direct reset input overrides all other inputs,
including the clock, and sets all flip-flips to
zero.

You can drag this component to another position
by clicking inside the body of the port, hold
the mouse button, move to the new position,
and release the mouse button.
