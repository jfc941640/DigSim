Oscilator

The oscilator is synchronized with the master clock, and
changes its level every simulation cycle.
Its output is at TTL level and can drive every input in
DigSim.

    0 = inactive = GND = 0V = OFF
        (Wires are green when inactive)
    1 = active = Vcc = 5V = ON
        (Wires are red when active)

You can drag this component to another position
by clicking inside the body of the port, hold
the mouse button, move to the new position,
and release the mouse button.
